Lyroke ðŸŽ¶
Lyroke is a work-in-progress project aiming to build a music recognition and lyrics extraction system. The final goal is to create a CLI-based lyrical video, where a song plays in the background and synced lyrics appear on the command line with minimal latency.

This project is currently read-only and under development.

How It Works (For Now)
